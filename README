I pretty much just stole this from:

http://blog.choonkeat.com/weblog/2006/05/svn2svn.html

and put it here so I could make changes to it and share it easily.

Original file header:

# 
# svn2svn
# 
# Replicates changesets from one SVN repository to another, includes diffs 
# and comments of each revision, but
# - Excludes svn property changes
# - Excludes revisions without file modifications (e.g. new directory)
#
# Since each revision of the source repository is checked out as r{\d+} sub 
# directories, the whole process may take hours, depending on connectivity.
#
# Works on unix only, with 'svn' and 'svnadmin' commandline tools. Written 
# and used on Ubuntu 5.10. Provided as-is and absolutely no warranty - aka 
# Don't bet your life on it
# 
# License: same as Subversion
